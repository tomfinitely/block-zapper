A powerful container block with granular control to selectively remove custom properties from child blocks.

== Description ==

Block Zapper is a container block similar to the WordPress Group block, but with selective superpowers: the ability to remove specific types of custom properties from child blocks contained within it using granular checkbox controls.

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL WARNING**: Block Zapper CANNOT save data! ANY data left in Block Zapper will be LOST when you close the browser window/tab. It is a styling cleanup tool only. Do NOT use it to store important content, data, or information that needs to be preserved. The zap functionality will remove custom properties and styling - this is NOT a data storage solution!

This block is perfect for:

* Creating clean sections on your website with precise control
* Grouping related content blocks together
* Selectively resetting specific customizations while keeping others
* Managing complex layouts with fine-tuned cleanup options
* Preserving important content like media while removing styling

The selective "ZAP!" functionality in the block inspector allows you to choose exactly what to remove from any blocks placed inside the Block Zapper container.

== Key Features ==

* **Two Zap Modes**: 
  * ‚ö° **Selective Zap**: Choose exactly what to remove with 7 granular categories
  * üí• **Mega Zap**: Nuclear option that removes ALL styling while preserving content
  
* **Granular Control Categories**:
  * ‚öôÔ∏è Block settings (layout, alignment, etc.)
  * üé® Block styles (colors, gradients, backgrounds) 
  * üîß Custom properties (fonts, spacing, borders, effects)
  * üì∏ Keep images and videos (recommended for both modes)
  * üìù Custom classes (Additional CSS class(es))
  * ‚öì Custom anchors (HTML anchor)
  * üè∑Ô∏è HTML element selections (alignment, tags)

* **Smart Preservation**: Essential content like text, images, and URLs are always preserved
* **Media Protection**: Robust option to keep all media-related attributes intact in both modes
* **Icon Block Support**: Full protection for Nick Diego's Icon Block plugin attributes
* **Accessibility**: Full ARIA support, screen reader compatibility, and contextual descriptions
* **Security**: Secure error handling, content sanitization, and production-safe logging
* **Visual Feedback**: Clear status display showing blocks and properties count
* **Undo Support**: All changes can be undone with standard WordPress undo
* **Real-time Updates**: See changes immediately in the editor

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the zap button delete my content? =

No! The zap functionality only removes the specific types of properties you select. Your actual text content, images, links, and core block structure remain completely intact. Essential content attributes are always preserved regardless of your selections.

= Can I undo the zap action? =

Yes, you can use the standard WordPress undo functionality (Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z) to restore the properties if you zap them by mistake.

= What's the difference between Selective Zap and Mega Zap? =

Selective Zap lets you choose specific categories to remove with granular control. Mega Zap is the nuclear option that removes ALL styling properties while keeping only essential content and media (if selected).

= Why should I keep "Keep images and videos" checked? =

This option preserves important media attributes including image sources, alt text, video controls, cover block backgrounds, and Icon Block plugin attributes. Unchecking it will remove these essential media properties and could break your media blocks.

= Does "Keep images and videos" work in Mega Zap mode? =

Yes! As of version 0.3.0, the media preservation feature works correctly in both Selective Zap and Mega Zap modes, with identical protection for all media types including Icon Block plugin attributes.

= Can I zap blocks multiple times with different settings? =

Yes! You can run multiple zap operations with different checkbox combinations and modes. The block remembers your last settings for convenience.

= Will this affect blocks outside the Block Zapper? =

No, the zap action only affects blocks that are direct children of the Block Zapper container. Other blocks on your page remain untouched.

= Can I store important data inside Block Zapper blocks? =

ABSOLUTELY NOT! Block Zapper CANNOT save or store data. ANY data left in Block Zapper will be LOST when you close the browser window/tab. It is a styling cleanup tool only. Do NOT use it for storing important content, data, or information. The zap functionality will remove custom properties and styling - this is NOT a data storage solution! Use it only for cleaning up styling on blocks where you want to reset or remove customizations.
