A powerful container block with granular control to selectively remove custom properties from child blocks.

== Description ==

Block Zapper is a container block similar to the WordPress Group block, but with selective superpowers: the ability to remove specific types of custom properties from child blocks contained within it using granular checkbox controls.

This block is perfect for:

* Creating clean sections on your website with precise control
* Grouping related content blocks together
* Selectively resetting specific customizations while keeping others
* Managing complex layouts with fine-tuned cleanup options
* Preserving important content like media while removing styling

The selective "ZAP!" functionality in the block inspector allows you to choose exactly what to remove from any blocks placed inside the Block Zapper container.

== Key Features ==

* **Granular Control**: Choose exactly what to zap with 7 different categories:
  * ‚öôÔ∏è Block settings (layout, alignment, etc.)
  * üé® Block styles (colors, gradients, backgrounds) 
  * üîß Custom properties (fonts, spacing, borders, effects)
  * üì∏ Keep images and videos (recommended)
  * üìù Custom classes (Additional CSS class(es))
  * ‚öì Custom anchors (HTML anchor)
  * üè∑Ô∏è HTML element selections (alignment, tags)

* **Smart Preservation**: Essential content like text, images, and URLs are always preserved
* **Media Protection**: Option to keep all media-related attributes intact
* **Visual Feedback**: Clear status display showing blocks and properties count
* **Undo Support**: All changes can be undone with standard WordPress undo
* **Real-time Updates**: See changes immediately in the editor

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the zap button delete my content? =

No! The zap functionality only removes the specific types of properties you select. Your actual text content, images, links, and core block structure remain completely intact. Essential content attributes are always preserved regardless of your selections.

= Can I undo the zap action? =

Yes, you can use the standard WordPress undo functionality (Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z) to restore the properties if you zap them by mistake.

= What happens if I don't select any zap options? =

The "SELECTIVE ZAP!" button will be disabled until you select at least one zapping option. This prevents accidental clicks when no changes would be made.

= Why should I keep "Keep images and videos" checked? =

This option preserves important media attributes like image sources, alt text, video controls, and accessibility features. Unchecking it could remove these essential media properties and break your media blocks.

= Can I zap blocks multiple times with different settings? =

Yes! You can run multiple zap operations with different checkbox combinations. The block remembers your last settings for convenience.

= Will this affect blocks outside the Block Zapper? =

No, the zap action only affects blocks that are direct children of the Block Zapper container. Other blocks on your page remain untouched.
